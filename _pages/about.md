Warwick Mathematics Society is here to help you! Whether you're studying maths and want an easy way to meet your course-mates, need some extra help, or want nothing to do with numbers - we're the society for you. Laid back, friendly and approachable, we aim to provide exciting opportunities for fun-filled socials to help you relax after a long day of lectures (or not, as the case may be!), whilst our fantastic academic team ensure you still get the grades you deserve...
