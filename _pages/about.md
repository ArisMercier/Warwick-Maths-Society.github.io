# Academics

### Maths Caf√©

Every Wednesday, we run a drop-in help session in the undergraduate workroom with free snacks provided. Bring along some assignment sheets or any other mathematics that you might be struggling with, and you can seek help from our Academic Supports or other attendees.

<br/>

### Revision Guides

We have a collection of condensed module notes/additional revision material, accessible from the navigation bar above. The majority of these were written by Kit, and the curriculum has changed since they were created, so some of the older guides are slightly dated. However, they should still serve as useful revision material.

A more complete reference book which may also be useful can be found <a href="https://desyncthethird.github.io/Reference.pdf">here</a>.

If you would like to contribute some notes, or gain access to a WMX guide template LaTeX file, please get in touch with `@.desync` on the WMS or WMX Discord server.

### Second Year Essay Archive

We have compiled a collection of previous essays that you can use for reference. You can use it to see past topics covered; to gauge how difficult or accessible topics should be; how long the essay should be; or just to read at leisure to learn about some new maths from other students -- after all, second year essays should be accessible to other second year students.

<br/>

### Talks

We run academic talks in the department on a weekly basis, where you can learn about the research of current lecturers, PhD students, and other guest speakers.
