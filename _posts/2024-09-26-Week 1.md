On **Sunday Week 0 (28th)**, we have a **Board Games social**, where we will have a large selection of board games available in the [Undergraduate Workroom](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c88f9421e6f5928c0e63b?projectId=warwick), starting from **1600**. This is a great opportunity to meet others interested in maths (especially those outside your year) in a relaxed environment, so please do drop in whenever you're free. We will also be bringing pizza later in the evening.

Note that this is a sober social; please do not bring alcohol to this social.

On **Wednesday (2nd)**, we will be running our first **Maths Café** of the year. Normally, Maths Café runs from 1200 to 1400, but as we are expecting larger numbers than usual for the first week, the first session will start at **1100** instead. As usual, we will be bringing (a small amount of) food for you to enjoy.

If you have any questions about academics, module options, or any general queries about the university, our academic support officers (and many other attendees) will be happy to help.

On **Thursday (3rd)**, we have our first **WMS Talk**, with guest speaker Dr Ed Brambley, starting at **1800**.

**Topic/title TBA**.

On **Friday (3rd)**, we are running **Coffee and Cake** from **1400** to 1500. (In week 0, the event was 2 hours long to accomodate the higher number of attendees, but will be 1 hour from now on.)

**Location TBD**.
