We are excited to offer a chance for **2nd**, **3rd**, and **4th year** students to become mentors for current 1st year students!

This mentorship program aims to pair students with similar academic interests. In many cases, multiple mentors will be assigned to a group of mentees, allowing for a supportive and collaborative learning environment.

This is a fantastic opportunity to try your hand at teaching, sharpen your communication skills, and gain valuable volunteering experience — perfect for enhancing your CV or LinkedIn profile!

Please take a moment to fill out [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/voUg1YP8nkdFNJxw9), where you can specify your strongest modules and how frequently you'd like to meet with your mentees.

The application for mentors will remain open until **Friday (11th)**. We will then open mentee applications the following Monday.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out at [vp@warwickmaths.org](mailto:vp@warwickmaths.org).

We look forward to your participation!
