In collaboration with UWCS, we are running an introductory workshop for the LaTeX typesetting system, aimed predominantly at first and second year CS and maths students (though all are welcome!).

Learn how to harness the power of LaTeX to typeset your documents and write beautiful problem sheets, amazing reports, and more. This session will particularly help for those who have no experience with programming, but feel free to come along if you're already comfortable using LaTeX and want to ask for more advanced LaTeX help from our resident experts.

The first session will be on **Wednesday (16th)**, from **1700** to 1900. You are also welcome (and encouraged) to drop in to the weekly Maths Caf√© to practice typing up some LaTeX: our academic officers will be happy to help you.
